                <p>Mbesses, Mtabka or  Mtekba this delicious Algerian galette that melt in your mouth delicious.  
                    Made of semolina and butter , very similar to Bradj or Makrout or even the Moroccan harcha.   
                    This galette is very easy and quick to make.In Kabylie we have the cake with olive oil.  
                    This is often served with mint tea or coffee latte for breakfast or to enjoyed with an afternoon cuppa. 
                    I like to generously drizzle with honey that's perfumed with orange blossom water, 
                    but you can optionally dip the galettes in the honey. These galettes are also traditionally served us 
                    with buttermilk for suhoor (the meal before the fast) during the holy month of Ramadan.</p>
